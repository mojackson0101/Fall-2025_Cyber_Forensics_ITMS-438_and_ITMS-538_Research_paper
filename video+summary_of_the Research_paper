Summary
Hi, I'm Medard from group 3, and our video discusses an AI-based approach to Internet of Things security. We highlight the challenges IoT networks face from attacks and present a new security solution that combines
artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Our research showed that our AI model achieved a detection precision of 95.2% for phishing attacks, reduced authentication latency by 66.6%, and decreased energy 
consumption by 31.8% compared to traditional methods. While our results are promising, they are not perfect, and we suggest future work on advanced adversarial defense mechanisms and optimizing blockchain efficiency. 
I encourage viewers to consider these findings and think about how we can further enhance IoT security.
